## The word goes far. (14-21)

- God sends His near word far through the <answer>preaching of His people</answer>

*"Sending implies on the one side a restriction, but on the other an enhancement, of the power of the herald.  The one who sends gives him the content of the messae and authority.  The disciples do not roclaime their own discoveries or insights....  A preacher is not a reporter who recounts his own eperiences.  He is the angent of someone higher whose will he loudly and clearly makes known to the public.  Without calling and sending, preaching is a self-contradition and even a deception.  It holds our something which has no reality.  If there is no sending, the preaching of Christ is propaganda, not mission."* - G. Freidrich
