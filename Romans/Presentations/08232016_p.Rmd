## Romans 11:33-36

<br>
```
"Oh, the depth of the riches and widsom and knowledge of God! 
How unsearchable are his judgements and how inscrutable his ways!

'For who has known the mind of the Lord, 
or who has been his counselor?'

'Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?'

For from him and through him and to him are all things. 
To him be glory for ever. Amen."
```
